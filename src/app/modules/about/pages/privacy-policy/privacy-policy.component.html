              <p>
                  This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we, One 2 Many Education Private Limited (referred to as “PADHO LEEKHO” or “we” or “us”), collect, use and share information about our users (“you”) through our Platform. Please review our Terms of
                  Use and Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the “Terms”) that govern the use of the Platform and the Programs. This Privacy Policy shall form a part of the Terms by way of reference. All capitalised terms not defined in this
                  Privacy Policy have the respective meanings set forth in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy applies only to the part of the Platform provided by PADHO LEEKHO, and we are not responsible for the practices of persons, companies, institutions
                  or websites that PADHO LEEKHO does not control, manage or employ.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Please understand that by using our Platform or submitting any Personally Identifiable Information (defined below) to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use, disclose and retain your information (including but not limited to your Personally
                  Identifiable Information) in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. PADHO LEEKHO reserves the right to share the information collected hereunder with its own affiliates. In the
                  event of sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are transferred as part of the transaction. If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not
                  provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, we may not be able to provide you with the services
                  that can be offered on our Platform.

                  1. INFORMATION COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY
              </h5>
              <p>
                  Some of our Platform’s functionality may be used without revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the Programs, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Platform,
                  then the only information we collect will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information like the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access
                  certain features and benefits on our Platform, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include, but not be limited to,
                  information such as your name, email address, contact number (cellular and landline), educational qualification(s), Aadhaar number, PAN, social security and tax identification numbers, and post-qualification or work experience among
                  other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to PADHO LEEKHO. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Platform, the information you receive when
                  using the Platform, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept valid because it is one of the primary channels through which we communicate with you.
              </p>

                  2. INFORMATION COLLECTION
              </h5>
              <p><b>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
              <p>
                  When you come to our Platform, we may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Platform were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were
                  “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs through which you connected with our Platform. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Platform.
                  Although such information may not be considered Personally Identifiable Information, based on local laws, we may be able to determine a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity
                  from an IP address. We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the Platform visitors to track the total of number of visitors on the Platform in aggregate form and to identify the type of Internet web browser (e.g., Internet
                  Explorer®) and operating system (e.g., Windows®) used by them. This information allows us to continuously improve our Platform and services.

                  things, your name, postal address, email address, contact number, social security or tax identification numbers, login credentials (in the case of registered users), educational qualification(s), salary information, working goals,
                  post-qualification experience, and photographs. We collect demographic information such as your gender, socio-economic status, and other similar personal information. In the case of scholarships, refunds or referrals, we will collect
                  your bank account information. Other than this, we do not collect any of your financial information, and all payments are processed by third-party payment gateway providers.

                  PADHO LEEKHO, or its Educational Partners and third-party service providers, may, for instance, collect certain information from you in conjunction with assignments, exams and other assessments related to the online course. For example, as part of a proctored
                  exam for a course, PADHO LEEKHO (or its third-party service providers) may collect certain Personally Identifiable Information from you in order to (a) verify or authenticate your identity or submissions made by you, such as a signature
                  for a test or an assignment log, a photograph or a recording of you (e.g., using a webcam) or information included on a photo identification card or document, or (b) monitor your performance during an exam to confirm that you are abiding
                  by the applicable test rules or requirements (e.g., confirming that you are not using prohibited resources). PADHO LEEKHO may also collect information from you or about your performance or your accomplishments, such as quiz/exam scores,
                  grades, project evaluations, teacher evaluations and other evaluations of your performance or accomplishments.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Should you need any financial assistance, PADHO LEEKHO may recommend certain third-party credit facility providers. Should you opt to sign up with such credit facility providers, any information you provide to them will be governed by their terms of use
                  and policies, as you would be their direct customer. Please note, PADHO LEEKHO does not control, manage or regulate such third-party providers.

              <p>
                  We may receive information about you if you use any of the other platforms we operate or the other services we provide. In this case, the data may be shared internally and combined with the data collected on the Platform. We are also working closely with

                  and may receive information about you from such sources. We may also receive your information from your employers, educational institution or scholarship providers, where your Program is partly or fully sponsored by such a third-party.
                  The third-party sponsoring your participation in the Programs may provide us your information, subject to our agreement with them and, therefore, the third-party sponsor may be the controller with respect to such data. In cases where
                  you have been referred under any referral scheme, we will receive your information from the referrer.

              <p>
                  We use your information for managing and processing purposes, including, but not limited to, tracking attendance, progress and completion of a Program. As part of our management and processing of the Program, we will use certain Personally Identifiable
                  Information to administer exams, projects, and other assessments for the Program. For example, as part of an exam, PADHO LEEKHO may use certain information collected from you in order to verify your identity or to monitor your performance
                  during the exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable testing rules or requirements.

                  We may use your Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide such services to you and for quality control purposes, and we may also archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you. For example, PADHO LEEKHO may make
                  available to you chat room services that allow you to communicate with PADHO LEEKHO’s staff members or your peers in the same cohort, and we may use and share your Personally Identifiable Information to provide these services to you.
                  In another example, PADHO LEEKHO’s staff members may create groups on WhatsApp (or similar service providers) with other students and make you a member of such a group. These groups may be used to provide services in conjunction with
                  the Programs, including, but not limited to, updates related to the Programs, details of potential employers, etc. Please be aware that the information disclosed on a third-party service provider’s platform will be dependent and subject
                  to such third-party’s privacy policies and/or on your settings regarding what information you have consented to share with them. PADHO LEEKHO and/or its associates shall have no liability in this regard whatsoever.

              <p>
                  PADHO LEEKHO may use certain companies that enable you to establish a membership to participate in digital wallets, payment services or rewards programs. If you elect to do so, we will disclose to such companies your information that is necessary to make
                  their programs work and support your membership with them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs, and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company
                  with whom you establish such memberships. Billing information may be archived by us or our providers. We may archive Personally Identifiable Information other than billing information and/or use it for future communications with you.

                  we may connect with you via a phone call, email you questionnaires, or request you to attend workshops.
